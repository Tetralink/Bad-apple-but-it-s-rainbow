# Bad Apple but it's Rainbow
A program that transforms a video into a series of monochrome frames, adds a rainbow effect, and renders the final video.

### How to use:
-Download bad_apple.py

-Use the provided .mp4 file in the repository, or your own (a black and white video works best for a good result)

-You can adjust the rainbow parameters with speeds_0 / speeds_1 (set them to [0,0,0] / [0,0,0] to disable the effect)
COLOR_0 and COLOR_1 are the base colors

-Just run the program (the .mp4 file needs to be in the same directory as the script)
